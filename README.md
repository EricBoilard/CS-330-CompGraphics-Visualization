  How do I approach designing software?
  
    When I approach designing software I have a few main concerns that I follow throughout the process. I focus on keeping my code modular and easy to read, adding comments when necessary and providing visual breaks to help in understanding how the code is divided up when functions are not abundant. I focus on keeping my code inline with a consistent naming convention and I pay attention to the flow of the code. The design should be easy to understand from perspectives other than my own and it should represent coding best practices. Additionally, I created the base functions first, the code that was necessary to build a simple 2D and 3D scene. After each milestone topic was understood the additional code was added. In essence, I created the base function of the code and then I added additional functionality later on in chunks.

  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  
    My work on this project has helped me understand the importance of modular code and creating functions to help break up long runs of code. The project was over 1000 lines and in one file, this can be a lot to take in when someone is trying to read it and make sense of it. Thankfully I was able to create functions and add visual breaks in my code which made it easy to understand where one function ended and another began. 

  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  
    The design process was similar to the approach I mentioned before. A consitent naming convention was used, the code was made to be modular with functions and visual breaks for better understanding, comments were included to offer additional explanation of the codes purpose, and coding best practices were used to keep the files professional and organized. 

  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  
    These tactics that I used for my project can be applied to future work in just about any aspect. The code itself was based around coding best practices and I used a simple visual break style to avoid using other classes and files when not needed. This could be used on future projects that are smaller or similar in size as larger projects benefit from having code in different files to cut down on single file size and increase readability. 

  How do I approach developing programs?
  
    Developing programs is something that I try to approach with caution as going to fast without a thorough plan can lead to messy code later on. I plan my approach with a rough text file and psudocode first to gain an understanding of the general structure and then when I have a concrete plan I start building the foundational elements. 

  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    
    There were no new development strategies used in the development of my 3D scene other than testing and debugging my code more than I normally would for other types of C++ programs. 

  How did iteration factor into your development?
  
    Iteration was a huge part of the development as most of the basics of OpenGL involve loops of some sort and iterating through the program correctly was important in it running the way that it should. Some items like keyboard and mouse input drove less importance when it came to iteration and placement but the drawing functions of OpenGL were very iteration heavy.

  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  
    My own approach evolved by intaking more information through research to complete the code, learning segment by segment and then implementing the whole piece as one function. 

  How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  
    Computer Science can help me in reaching my goals by allowing me to become a better programmer and to understand the logic behind code better. Through computer science I hope to achieve many years of experience and the ability to keep up with new technologies and trends as the years progress. 

  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  
    Computational graphics and visualizations can give me much needed knowledge and skills that will help be in designing a lot of my front end projects that will be a part of my portfolio. This will help me on my educational pathway by reinforcing useful information but also by helping me create more advanced code and applications. 

  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    
    As mentioned before these new skills are going to be very useful in designing front end projects which will help me gain experience needed to pursue this field in my degree of study. Being able to add this to my resume and expand on the basics that I now know. Now that I have the foundations in place I can expand this into more professional aspects and examples that can help me get better careers and open more doors to careers in computational graphics and visualization.
